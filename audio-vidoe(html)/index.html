                                    London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom.[8][9] The city stands on the River Thames in the south-east of England, at the head of its 50-mile (80 km) estuary leading to the North Sea. London has been a major settlement for two millennia. Londinium was founded by the Romans.[10] The City of London, London's ancient core and financial centre − an area of just 1.12 square miles (2.9 km2) and colloquially known as the Square Mile − retains boundaries that closely follow its medieval limits.[11][12][13][14][15][note 1] The adjacent City of Westminster is an Inner London borough and has for centuries been the location of much of the national government. Thirty one additional boroughs north and south of the river also comprise modern London. London is governed by the mayor of London and the London Assembly.[16][note 2][17]

                                London has a diverse range of people and cultures, and more than 300 languages are spoken in the region.[44] Its estimated mid-2018 municipal population (corresponding to Greater London) was 8,908,081,[5] the third-most populous of any city in Europe[45] and accounts for 13.4% of the UK population.[46] London's urban area is the third most populous in Europe, after Moscow and Paris, with 9,787,426 inhabitants at the 2011 census.[47] The London commuter belt is the second-most populous in Europe, after the Moscow Metropolitan Area, with 14,040,163 inhabitants in 2016.[note 4][4][48]
